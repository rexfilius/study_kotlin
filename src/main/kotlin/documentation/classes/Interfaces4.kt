 * For functional interfaces, you can use SAM conversions that help make your code more

 * implements a functional interface manually, you can use a lambda expression.
 * With a SAM conversion, Kotlin can convert any lambda expression whose signature
 * matches the signature of the interface's single method into an instance
 * of a class that implements the interface

/**
 * Functional interfaces and type aliases serve different purposes:
 * ...
 * 1. Type aliases are just names for existing types â€“ they don't create a new type,
 * while functional interfaces do.
 * 2. Type aliases can have only one member, while functional interfaces
 * can have multiple non-abstract members and one abstract member.
 * 3. Functional interfaces can also implement and extend other interfaces.
 * ...
 * Considering the above, functional interfaces are more flexible and
 * provide more capabilities than type aliases
