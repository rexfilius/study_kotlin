/**
 * - Can you eliminate allocation overhead and preserve O(1) dequeues? If you donâ€™t
 * have to worry about your queue growing beyond a fixed size, you can use a
 * different approach like the ring buffer.
 * - For raywenderlich.util.example, you might have a game of Monopoly with five players. You can use a
 * queue based on a ring buffer to keep track of whose turn is coming up next.
 * - A ring buffer, also known as a circular buffer, is a fixed-size array. This data
 * structure strategically wraps around to the beginning when there are no more
 * items to remove at the end.
