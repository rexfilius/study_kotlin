/**
 * - Radix sort is a non-comparative algorithm for sorting integers in linear time.
 * - There are many implementations of radix sort that focus on different problems.
 * To keep things simple, this implementation focuses on sorting base 10 integers
 * while investigating the least significant digit (LSD) variant of radix sort.
 * - Radix sort is one of the fastest sorting algorithms. The average time complexity
 * is O(k Ã— n), where k is the number of significant digits of the largest number,
 * and n is the number of integers in the list.
 * - Radix sort works best when k is constant, which occurs when all numbers in the
 * list have the same count of significant digits. Its time complexity then becomes
 * O(n). Radix sort also incurs an O(n) space complexity, as you need space to store
 * each bucket.
