/**
 * The Kotlin standard library provides extension functions for grouping collection
 * elements. The basic function groupBy() takes a lambda function and returns a Map. In
 * this map, each key is the lambda result and the corresponding value is the List of
 * elements on which this result is returned. This function can be used, for example, to
 * group a list of String by their first letter.
 * ...
 * You can also call groupBy() with a second lambda argument â€“ a value transformation
 * function. In the result map of groupBy() with two lambdas, the keys produced by
 * keySelector function are mapped to the results of the value transformation function
 * instead of the original elements

    /**
     * If you want to group elements and then apply an operation to all groups at one time,
     * use the function groupingBy(). It returns an instance of the Grouping type. The
     * Grouping instance lets you apply operations to all groups in a lazy manner: the
     * groups are actually built right before the operation execution.
     * Grouping supports the following operations:
     * ...
     * [1] eachCount() counts the elements in each group.
     * [2] fold() and reduce() perform fold and reduce operations on each group as
     *     a separate collection and return the results.
     * [3] aggregate() applies a given operation subsequently to all the elements in each
     *     group and returns the result. This is the generic way to perform any operations
     *     on a Grouping. Use it to implement custom operations when fold or reduce are
     *     not enough
