/**
 * The class declaration consists of the class name, the class header (specifying its type
 * parameters, the primary constructor etc.) and the class body, surrounded by curly braces
 * Both the header and the body are optional; if the class has no body, curly braces
 * can be omitted.
 * ...
 * The code below declares a class named [Customer] without any properties or user-defined
 * constructors. A non-parameterized default constructor is created by Kotlin automatically
