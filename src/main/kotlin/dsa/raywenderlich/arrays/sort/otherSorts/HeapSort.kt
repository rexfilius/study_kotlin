/**
 * - Heapsort is another comparison-based algorithm that sorts an array in ascending
 * order using a heap.
 * - Heapsort takes advantage of a heap being, by definition, a partially sorted
 * binary tree with the following qualities:
 * (1) In a max heap, all parent nodes are larger than their children.
 * (2) In a min heap, all parent nodes are smaller than their children.
 * - Even though you get the benefit of in-memory sorting, the performance of heap
 * sort is O(n log n) for its best, worse and average cases. This is because you have
 * to traverse the whole array once and, every time you swap elements, you must
 * perform a sift down, which is an O(log n) operation.
 * - Heap sort is also not a stable sort because it depends on how the elements are
 * laid out and put into the heap. If you were heap-sorting a deck of cards by their
 * rank, e.g. you might see their suite change order with respect to the original deck.
