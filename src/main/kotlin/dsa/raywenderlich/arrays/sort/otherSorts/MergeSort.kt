/**
 * - Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. With a time complexity
 * of O(n log n), it's one of the fastest of all general-purpose sorting algorithms.
 * - The idea behind merge sort is divide and conquer â€” to break a big problem into
 * several smaller, easier-to-solve problems, and then combine those solutions into a
 * final result. The merge sort mantra is to split first and merge after.
 * - When it comes to sorting algorithms, any list that's shorter than two elements
 * is already sorted
