/**
 * - Binary search is one of the most efficient searching algorithms with a time
 * complexity of O(log n). This is comparable with searching for an element inside
 * a balanced binary search tree.
 * - Two conditions need to be met before you can use binary search:
 * (1) The collection must be able to perform index manipulation in constant time.
 * Kotlin's collections that can do this includes the Array and the ArrayList.
 * (2) The collection must be sorted.
 * - (***) -> Binary search is recursive, so you need to be able to pass in a range
 * to search. The parameter range is made optional by giving it a default value;
 * this lets you start the search without having to specify a range. In this case,
 * the 'indices' property of ArrayList is used, which covers all valid indexes of
 * the collection.

/**
 * Binary search is a powerful algorithm to learn, and it comes up often in
 * programming interviews. Whenever you read something along the lines of
 * "Given a sorted array...", consider using the binary search algorithm.
 *
 * Also, if you're given a problem that looks like it's going to be O(n-squared) to
 * search, consider doing some upfront sorting. With upfront sorting, you can use
 * binary searching to reduce complexity to the cost of the sort at O(n log n).
