/**
 * - Quicksort is another comparison-based sorting algorithm. Much like merge sort,
 * it uses the same strategy of divide and conquer. One important feature of
 * quicksort  is choosing a pivot point.
 *
 * - The most important part of implementing quicksort is choosing the right
 * partitioning strategy. The partitioning strategies include:
 * (1) Choosing the middle element as a pivot.
 * (2) Lomuto, or choosing the last element as a pivot.
 * (3) Hoare, or choosing the first element as a pivot.
 * (4) Median of three, using the median of three pivot strategy
 * (5) Dutch flag partitioning
