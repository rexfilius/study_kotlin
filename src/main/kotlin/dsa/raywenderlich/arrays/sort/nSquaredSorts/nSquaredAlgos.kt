package raywenderlich.arrays.sort.nSquaredSorts

/**
 * O(n²) time complexity is not great performance, but the sorting algorithms in this
 * category are easy to understand and useful in some scenarios. These algorithms are
 * space efficient, and they only require constant O(1) additional memory space.
 *
 * For small data sets, these sorts compare favorably against more complex sorts.
 * It's usually not recommended to use O(n²) in production code, but you'll need to
 * start somewhere, and these algorithms are a great place to start.
 *
 * n-squared algorithms: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort.
 *
 * All of these are comparison-based sorting methods. In other words, they rely on a
 * comparison method, such as the less than operator, to order elements.
 *
 * You measure a sorting technique's general performance by counting the number of
 * times this comparison gets called.
