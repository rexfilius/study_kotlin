package documentation.dataStructures.sequences

/**
 * Along with collections, the Kotlin standard library contains another container type;
 * sequences (Sequence<T> ). Sequences offer the same functions as Iterable but implement
 * another approach to multi-step collection processing.
 * ...
 * When the processing of an Iterable includes multiple steps, they are executed eagerly:
 * each processing step completes and returns its result â€“ an intermediate collection.
 * The following step executes on this collection. In turn, multi-step processing of
 * sequences is executed lazily when possible: actual computing happens only when
 * the result of the whole processing chain is requested.
 * ...
 * The order of operations execution is different as well: Sequence performs all the
 * processing steps one-by-one for every single element. In turn, Iterable completes each
 * step for the whole collection and then proceeds to the next step.
 * ...
 * So, the sequences let you avoid building results of intermediate steps, therefore
 * improving the performance of the whole collection processing chain. However, the lazy
 * nature of sequences adds some overhead which may be significant when processing smaller
 * collections or doing simpler computations. Hence, you should consider both
 * Sequence and Iterable and decide which one is better for your case

     * the provided function returns null. So, the sequence in the example below is

     * Finally, there is a function that lets you produce sequence elements one by one or

     * expression containing calls of yield() and yieldAll() functions. They return an
     * element to the sequence consumer and suspend the execution of sequence() until the
     * next element is requested by the consumer. yield() takes a single element as an
     * argument; yieldAll() can take an Iterable object, an Iterator, or another Sequence.
     * A Sequence argument of yieldAll() can be infinite. However, such a call must be the
     * last: all subsequent calls will never be executed
