     * For traversing collection elements, the Kotlin standard library supports the
     * commonly used mechanism of iterators â€“ objects that provide access to the elements
     * sequentially without exposing the underlying structure of the collection. Iterators
     * are useful when you need to process all the elements of a collection one-by-one,
     * e.g, print values or make similar updates to them. Iterators can be obtained for
     * inheritors of the Iterable<T> interface, including Set and List, by calling
     * the iterator() function.
     * ...
     * Once you obtain an iterator, it points to the first element of a collection; calling
     * the next() function returns this element and moves the iterator position to the
     * following element if it exists. Once the iterator passes through the last element,
     * it can no longer be used for retrieving elements; neither can it be reset
     * to any previous position
