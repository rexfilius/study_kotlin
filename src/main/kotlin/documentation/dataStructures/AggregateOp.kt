/**
 * Kotlin collections contain functions for commonly used aggregate operations â€“
 * operations that return a single value based on the collection content. Most of them
 * are well known and work the same way as they do in other languages:
 * ...
 * minOrNull() and maxOrNull() return the smallest and the largest element respectively.
 * On empty collections, they return null.
 * average() returns the average value of elements in the collection of numbers.
 * sum() returns the sum of elements in the collection of numbers.
 * count() returns the number of elements in a collection

     * maxWithOrNull() and minWithOrNull() take a Comparator object and return the largest
     * or smallest element according to that Comparator.
