 * - As a rule of thumb, you should use 'out T' in classes and methods that will not
 * modify T, but produce or use it as an output type. Contrary, you should use 'in T'
 * in classes and methods that will consume T, i.e. using it as an input type.
 * Following this rule will buy you type-safety when establishing class hierarchy sub-typing.
